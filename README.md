# Sequence To Sequence GRU for automatic Spelling Correction.
This repository contains code for an auto spell checker built using Pytorch as framework.
We have built encoder-decoder networks using GRU as the building block. Luong Attention mechanism was used to speeden up the training process and improve accuracy.
Characters (not words) were provided as input to the architecture while training and testing.   
This work is essencially an extension to DeepSpell by Tal Weiss. We have improver very significantly on training time.
